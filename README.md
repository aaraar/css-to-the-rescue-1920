In three weeks I create an innovative, experimental, yet pleasurable user experience by using CSS and SVG. No Javascrpt allowed.
The  goal is to create a cosmic journey to the restaurant at the end of the universe, experimenting with media queries for color (dark/light), language settings, reduced motion etc.

## How to install
### Requirements
- Node
- Yarn

# Step by step
1. Clone the project
2. Open terminal and navigate to the directory
3. Run `yarn`
4. Run `yarn dev`
5. Open a browser and navigate to [localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001)
#### Or go straight to [aaraar.github.io/css-to-the-rescue-1920](https://aaraar.github.io/css-to-the-rescue-1920)

## How to use
The journey has several layers to display the menu.
When opening the site in light-mode (OS or browser setting) there will be all kinds of pop-ups blocking you from using the site.
![Popups](./documentation/lightmode.png)
These pop-ups will be in an alien language, however they contain the crucial hint to continue. Either change the HTML lang from '👽' to 'en' to read it or copy and paste it somewhere else.
When the OS or browser is in darkmode, these pop-ups disappear and you can use the warpdrive (Star Trek reference in a D. Adams Joke? Yes!)
![Warpdrive](./documentation/warpdrive.png)
Click it and a Tie fighter will appear and flies through space (EVEN STAR WARS JOKES!!?? YES!!)
You will fly to the restaurant at the end of the universe and the menu portions will fly by.

Did not get a chance to read it?
Maybe try flying with a reduced motion (hint)
