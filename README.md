# CSS to the Rescue @cmda-minor-web 19-20

In three weeks I create an innovative, experimental, yet pleasurable user experience by using CSS and SVG. No Javascrpt allowed.

## Learning goals
- _Understanding the broader scope of CSS: You can show that CSS can be used for more than just styling web pages._
- _Understanding the progressive enhancement parts of CSS: You can show that you can use the cascade, inheritance and specificity in your project_
- _Understanding the interactive parts of CSS: Is the UX fully enhanced within in given CSS scope?_
- _Stretching the learning goals as far as possible_
